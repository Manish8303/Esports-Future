            <p class="sectionsubtag">Esports, short for electronic sports, is a form of competition using video
                games.Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly
                between professional players, individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been a
                part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation
                by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a large surge in
                popularity.By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many
                game developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events. </p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag">The fighting game Street Fighter II (1991) popularized the concept of direct,
                tournament-level competition between two players.Previously, video games most often relied on high
                scores to determine the best player, but this changed with Street Fighter II, where players would
                instead challenge each other directly, "face-to-face," to determine the best player,paving the way
                for the competitive multiplayer and deathmatch modes found in modern action games.The popularity of
                fighting games such as Street Fighter and Marvel vs. Capcom in the 1990s led to the foundation of the
                international Evolution Championship Series (EVO) esports tournament in 1996.
                Large esports tournaments in the 1990s include the 1990 Nintendo World Championships, which toured
                across the United States, and held its finals at Universal Studios Hollywood in California. Nintendo
                held a 2nd World Championships in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System called the Nintendo
                PowerFest '94. There were 132 finalists that played in the finals in San Diego, California. Mike Iarossi
                took home 1st prize. Blockbuster Video also ran their own World Game Championships in the early 1990s,
                co-hosted by GamePro magazine. Citizens from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia,
                and Chile were eligible to compete. Games from the 1994 championships included NBA Jam and Virtua
                Racing.Television shows featuring esports during this period included the British shows GamesMaster and
                Bad
                Influence! the Australian game show A*mazing, where in one round contestants competed in a video game
                face off, and the Canadian game show Video & Arcade Top 10. Super Nintendo Entertainment System called

            <p class="sectionsubtag">The growth of esports in South Korea is thought to have been influenced by the mass
                building of broadband Internet networks following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It is also
                thought that the high unemployment rate at the time caused many people to look for things to do while
                out of work.Instrumental to this growth of esports in South Korea was the prevalence of the
                Komany-style internet caf√©/LAN gaming center, known as a PC bang. The Korean e-Sports Association, an
                arm of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, was founded in 2000 to promote and regulate esports
                in the country. Minister of Culture, Sports, and Tourism Park Jie-won coined the term "Esports" at
                the founding ceremony of the 21st Century Professional Game Association (currently Korean e-Sports
                Association) in 2000.

                "Evo Moment 37", also known as the "Daigo Parry", refers to a portion of a Street Fighter III: 3rd
                Strike semi-final match held at Evolution Championship Series 2004 (Evo 2004) between Daigo Umehara
                (playing Ken Masters) and Justin Wong (playing Chun-Li). During this match, Umehara made an unexpected
                comeback by parrying 15 consecutive hits of Wong's "Super Art" move while having only one pixel of
                vitality. .</p>
